$lang["A water billing system is a software application that helps manage the billing and invoicing process for water utilities or organizations that provide water services to customers. The system typically includes features such as meter reading, customer billing, payment processing, and reporting. The purpose of a water billing system is to streamline the billing process, reduce errors, and improve accuracy and efficiency. With a water billing system, water utilities can manage customer accounts, track water usage, and generate bills based on actual meter readings. Customers can also view their bills online, make payments electronically, and receive alerts about their account status. The Burayu Water Supply and Sewage Service Enterprise (BWSSSE) is responsible for providing water services to the city's residents.
